# Simple Shell

A simple shell project is a program that emulates the functionality of a command-line interface, where users can execute various commands and interact with the system. The main objective of this project is to create a functional shell program that can interpret and execute user commands.


## Project Overview: 
The simple shell project is a program that emulates the functionality of a command-line interface, where users can execute various commands and interact with the system. The primary goal of this project is to create a functional shell program that can interpret and execute user commands, providing a user-friendly and efficient command-line interface for users to interact with their system.

This simple shell project is designed to be highly modular and easily extensible, allowing developers to add new features and commands as needed. It provides users with a set of built-in commands that include basic file management, process management, and system information commands. Additionally, users can customize the shell with their own commands, aliases, and environment variables.

The program is written in C programming language,  and can run on various operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Windows. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and efficient, consuming minimal system resources while still providing powerful functionality.

This simple shell project is an excellent tool for developers, system administrators, and power users who frequently interact with the command-line interface. It provides an easy-to-use, customizable interface for executing various system commands and scripts, making it an essential tool for any command-line user.

## Getting Started: 
To download and install the shell program, please follow the following steps:

1. Go to the project repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Clone or download" button and then select "Download ZIP".
3. Extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
4. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
